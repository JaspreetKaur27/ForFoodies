# ForFoodies

Project Description: 
Helping users find somewhere to eat fast. This interactive self-service app is user-friendly and simple with the goal to help local Torontonians search for a place to eat. A list of recommendations are provided to the user.

Motivation for development: 
The three of us love food - whether we cook it ourselves or enjoy a delicious night out, food is what brought us together.
